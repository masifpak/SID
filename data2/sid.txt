ABSTRACT
Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) allows users to search directly on their outsourced encrypted data, in a way that the privacy
of both the files and the search queries is preserved. Naturally, with
every search query, some information is leaked. The leakage becomes even bigger when the scheme is dynamic (i.e. supports file
insertions and deletions). In this paper, we design a forward private
dynamic SSE scheme where file insertions and deletions do not leak
any information about previous queries executed by users. Then
we extend our construction to also support the crucial notion of
backward privacy. Moreover, our construction supports the multiclient model, in the sense that every user that holds the secret key
can perform search queries. Finally, our scheme also focuses on the
problem of synchronization by utilizing the functionality offered
by AMDâ€™s Secure Virtualization Encryption (SEV).
