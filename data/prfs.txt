Pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and their cousins, pseudorandom permutations
(PRPs), flgure as central tools in the design of protocols, especially those for sharedkey cryptography. At one level, PRFs and PRPs can be used to model block ciphers,
and they thereby enable the security analysis of protocols based on block ciphers.
But PRFs and PRPs are also a useful conceptual starting point in contexts where
block ciphers donâ€™t quite flt the bill because of their flxed block-length. So in this
chapter we will introduce PRFs and PRPs and investigate their basic properties.
