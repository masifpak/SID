Abstract: Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables a
client to perform searches over its outsourced encrypted files
while preserving privacy of the files and queries. Dynamic
schemes, where files can be added or removed, leak more information than static schemes. For dynamic schemes, forward
privacy requires that a newly added file cannot be linked to
previous searches. We present a new dynamic SSE scheme that
achieves forward privacy by replacing the keys revealed to the
server on each search. Our scheme is efficient and parallelizable and outperforms the best previous schemes providing forward privacy, and achieves competitive performance with dynamic schemes without forward privacy. We provide a full security proof in the random oracle model. In our experiments on
the Wikipedia archive of about four million pages, the server
takes one second to perform a search with 100,000 results.
